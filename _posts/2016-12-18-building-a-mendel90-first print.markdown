There is always that scary thought when first switching on a printer of which you have just spend a couple of hours doing the wiring and it's getting late. You wonder if you made a mistake... yet you are in to deep so you try anyway. Flick the switch and watch for any magic smoke or popcorn sounds........

W00t! no smoke no wierd sounds, so fire up pronterface and see if it heats up. In this case it did, so I pulled out my spool of PLA, and sliced a simple cube with pretty much default settings and low and behold filament gets extruded and the result even looks like a cube!

After a couple of prints and some fine tuning the result is actually quite pleasing, PETG sticks to the plain glass very well and looks super smooth.
The machine is very consistent and requires no adjustment between prints.
