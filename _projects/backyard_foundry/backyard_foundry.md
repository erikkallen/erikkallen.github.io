title: Backyard foundry

I recently decided to create my very own foundry for casting aluminium, here you can read about my journey into the world of casting.

### Backstory (Skip if boring)

The story began when I stumbled upon a Youtube video from Grant Thompson (The King of Random) where he created his own backyard foundry.

I immediately got excited and started to look for an excuse to build one of my own.
Luckily this excuses was not but a few clicks away for someone had built a lathe by simply casting aluminium parts. The magical name in all this is David Gingery who has published a book explaining to make your ver own Gingery lathe.

So that takes care of the excuse to build the foundry so lets gets started.
Because all the required materials en units used are different from the materials used in the video (I live in the Netherlands)  I decided to post my reciepe here for the lovely folks on the European side of the ocean.

### Materials used and where to get them

First of instead of using "Plaster of Paris" our local hardware store has something called "Goudband" or "Goldband" which should be similar if not the same.

It can be obtained at a Praxis, Formido, Gamma, Hornbach or Bauhaus for around &euro; 9,00

For the bucket I went to a local metal recycling company [Simmeren](http://www.simmeren.nl/) and got an old paint bucket 18.5L can and piece of stainless steel pipe for 1 Euro.
If there is no local recycling company a painting company or metal work shop might have something similar. Worst case you can go to the Xenos and buy a metal garbage bin, it should do the trick to but might be a bit more expensive.

As for the lid I tried to find a "bigmouth bucket" but could not, so instead I went to the Dutch version of the dollar store (Action) and got a bucket for doing the dishes. The price was around &euro; 1,30

For the brackets I used some threaded rod which I still had lying around, which I simply bent on the bench vice

### Steps taken

First of all I spilled some plaster on the tiles in the backyard and now there is this lovely white spot marking where I built my foundry. If your backyard decoration cannot handle a white spot on the floor, you should do the mixing and pouing of your materials on a plastic tarp or some cut up waste bags.

So.. on we go

* Fill the paint bucket with equal parts of Goudband and sand to the lower of the two blue rings.
* Add about 4 liters of water
* stir the whole mix with a piece of wood, your hands or an electric drill with mixer bit.
