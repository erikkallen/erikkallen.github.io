I just love 3D printing, I never thought that it would be so much fun, because we have a 3D printer at work but rarely use it, I never gave it too much attention.

Now that I have my own printer it feels like I can make all the silly things I wanted to try or fiddle with but never felt like it was worth spending too much money one to have made.

Also the fact that you can upgrade, repair, change fiddle and calibrate the device is very appealing to me
