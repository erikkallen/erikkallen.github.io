## Upgrades

#### Heated bed

* I put a piece of cardboard under the heated bed which significantly improved the warmup time.

#### X Carrage

* I printed a replacement X-Idler with tensioning screw from MazaaFIN [X-Idler Thing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1103976)

#### Y Carrage

* I printed a replacement Y-Idler with tensioning screws from bunjatec [Y-Idler Thing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1298757)

#### MK8 Fan air redirect for PETG

* I made an Air redirector because the extruder fan was blowing air on my print and the PETG filament does not like that.
