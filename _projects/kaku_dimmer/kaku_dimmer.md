title: Wireless (Klik aan Klik uit) dimmer
---
I recently replaced the wall dimmer of my living room lighting with a wireless controlled version.
This is all very nice but the only way to control the dimm factor is with a regular switch or remote.

The way to chhose the dimm factor is as follows:

* Turn on the dimmer
* Turn on the dimmer again the light will now fade from full bright to dim continiously.
* When you are happy with the brightness Turn on the dimmer once more to set the value.

After a bit of digging and wiring up an arduino with a 433.92Mhz radio I found out that using the KaKu library you can actually send the desired dim value to the dimmer and so a project was born.
